## Project Overview

This project aims to tackle the challenging task of Deepfake detection using state-of-the-art techniques. The project integrates robust image and video analysis, leveraging pre-trained models, data augmentation, and novel architectures to detect manipulated and synthetic Deepfake content. By employing a combination of HDDM (Hybrid Deepfake Detection Mechanism) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), the system targets improved accuracy and robustness for real-world applications.

### Features:

1. Detection of manipulated and synthetic Deepfake images and videos.
2. Use of advanced data augmentation techniques to enhance dataset diversity.
3. Integration of HDDM and GRU models for hybrid detection.
   - **HDDM** constructs unique textures from facial images using CNN to assess naturalness and detect manipulated and synthetic Deepfake attacks.
   - **GRU** is incorporated to handle temporal dependencies in video frames, improving the detection of video-based Deepfake content.
4. Evaluation metrics include confusion matrices, training loss, accuracy plots, and classification reports.

   Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning and face recognition technology, AI(Artificial Intelligence) experts have rated Deepfake cheating as the top AI threat. It is difficult for the human eye to distinguish the fake face images generated by Deepfake. Therefore, it has become a popular tool for criminals to seek benefits. Deepfake can be mainly divided into two types, a manipulated Deepfake that falsifies images of others by targeting real faces, and a synthetic Deepfake using GAN to generate a new fake image. So far, seldom cybersecurity system is able to detect these two types simultaneously. In this article, we aim to propose a hybrid Deepfake detection mechanism (HDDM) based on face texture and naturalness degree. HDDM constructs a unique texture from a facial image based on CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) and builds a naturalness degree recognition model via DNN(Deep Neural Network) to help cheating detection. Experimental results have proved that HDDM possesses a sound effect and stability for synthetic and manipulated Deepfake attacks. In particular, the WildDeepfake simulation has demonstrated the possibility of applying HDDM to the real world.
